# URL Shortener

This project is a basic URL shortener, made as a way to learn and get more experience in:

- React
- Node (Express)
- MongoDB
- Docker

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)

## Get Started

1. Run `make build`
2. Run `make run`
3. Once the Docker containers are ready, the interface should be available at `http://localhost:3000`
4. To stop the Docker containers, run `make stop`

## Todo

- Write tests
- Provide better error handling
- Allow better support for domains other than `http://localhost:3000`
- Make it look prettier! :)
