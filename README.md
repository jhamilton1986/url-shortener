# URL Shortener

This project is a basic URL shortener, made as a way to learn and get more experience in:

- React
- Node (Express)
- MongoDB
- Docker

To get up and running you will require [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on your machine.

Once the Docker daemon is running, to start the application run `docker-compose up` in the root of the project.

Once the Docker containers have started, the interface should then be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

## Todo

- Write tests
- Provide better error handling
- Allow better support for domains other than `http://localhost:3000`
- Make it look prettier! :)
